# Data Mining Link Analysis

The purpose of this report is to analyze the food pages network and detect the community within them. Using this information,
we can find common interests between the users. Network analysis has many implications, for instance, the knowledge that is
gathered can be used as a recommendation system. We can even take a step further and use this information for the purpose
of advertisements on different platforms. In this report, we will use two different methods to visualize our network, namely,
multilevel agglomerative edge bundling method, also known as Yifan Hu in Gephi, and graph drawing by force-directed
placement method, also known as Fruchterman Reingold in Gephi. The analysis and different methods which we will see in
future sections are no way limited to this dataset, therefore, we will use the food network dataset as an example and generalize
the idea for any type of network.
